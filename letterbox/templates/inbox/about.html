        Welcome to project EnCode. Compose a message to another user with a secret encryption-key.
        The message will be encrypted and will only be readable if the correct key is entered.
        Messages will appear on the public board in their encrypted state. If another user has access to or
        is able to correctly guess the encrpytion-key, your message may be deciphered and read.
        try composing a message to another user and viewing the message on the public message board
        in its encrypted state. Just remember to write down the encryption key you used!





    </p>
    <p>
        Note: For now, once the encryption key is entered by another user, it will be publically
        available unless overwritten.
